## What is Digital Essentials
---
Digital Essentials is a cyber security scheme from the UK government in 2013.

The scheme is aligned with the primary objective of the UK Governmentâ€™s National Cyber Security Strategy to make the UK a safer place to conduct business online by building a vibrant, resilient and secure cyberspace by 2015.
The Cyber Essentials scheme provides guidance to help organisations of all sizes to measure their defences against common forms of cyber-attacks. Selected by industry experts, the technical controls within
the scheme reflect those covered in well established standards. Cyber Essentials offers a sound foundation of basic hygiene measures that all types of organisations can implement and potentially build upon.

## Who is Cyber Essentials for?
Cyber Essentials is applicable to all organisations, of all sizes, and in all sectors. The UK Government is encouraging all organisations to look at the requirements and to adopt them.

# Security Audits & Penetration Testing

## During penetration testing we simulate an attempt at breaching your business so that you can fully appreciate the risks and the potential consequences of an intrusion.

Our expert security specialists examine the <strong>current state of your digital business</strong> to assess the resilience and to identify all the ways that your business could be affected.

###<strong>Audits</strong>

* <strong>Infrastructure Testing</strong>
  * Our reports detail the security vulnerabilities within your infrastructure that could potentially be exploited in an attack.
* <strong>Application Security Testing</strong>
  * Our penetration testing specialists will examine and assess all the key components of your application and supporting infrastructure.
* <strong>Social Engineering</strong>
  * We assess the ‘human element’ associated with risk and how threats such
as unauthorised physical entry into buildings, impersonation and deception can be addressed.
* <strong>Remote Access Security Testing</strong>
  * Issues such as laptop security, VPN security, access to remote servers, modems and the use of portable devices are considered.
* <strong>Wireless Security Testing</strong>
  * We can help you identify access points and rogue devices, analyse your security configurations, test for vulnerabilities, and implement appropriate security policies to mitigate the risks associated with an attack.
* <strong>Mobile Security Testing</strong>
  * Mobile devices are all attractive targets for malicious attackers. Having access to your corporate network via email, VPNs, and other remote access methods, a successful compromise can result in access to customer details, credit card and other sensitive data.
* <strong>IT Health Check</strong>
  * The service consists of an analysis of your chosen systems and network to identify any weaknesses based on widely encountered vulnerabilities and common configuration faults.
